## Notes in The Design Sprint Meetup

### The Design Sprint
**Definition -** The design sprint is a five-day process for answering critical business questions through design, prototyping, and testing ideas with customers.

**Why Design Sprint?**
- Start from design thinking [1]
  - Stage 1: Empathize—Research Your Users' Needs
  - Stage 2: Define—State Your Users' Needs and Problems
  - Stage 3: Ideate—Challenge Assumptions and Create Ideas
  - Stage 4: Prototype—Start to Create Solutions
  - Stage 5: Test—Try Your Solutions Out

- The frustrated points in design thinking:
  - No methodology 
  - The result of brain storming can not be validated
- design thinking _+ instructions_ ----> design sprint

**The good part that design sprint can help us**
- An efficient way to reduce uncertainty and to boost development cycles [3]
- In a Lean startup cycle: [3]
  - The lean  process

  - Our idea is the result of an intuition
 
  ![lean startup cycle intuition](http://www.teacuplab.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/1.intuition.png "lean startup cycle - intuition")

  - When we start building our idea we don’t know if it is valid yet
    - Until we launch our product, we cannot know if our hypothesis is true and it will make sense to our customers

  - Between our idea and its launch, inevitably, a period of uncertainty begins

  - The sprint gives teams a shortcut to learning without building and launching
    - Fast prototyping and immediate user validation
    - Learn fast from customers(users)

- But, does they remove uncertainty? [3]
  > No, they don’t, but Design Sprints drastically `shorten the time needed to get an answer from the customers` and, hence, they reduce the risks of making bad decisions as we get an initial validation in just five days.

**How Design Sprint Works [2]**

- Instructions
  - DAY1: Map 
    - *Start at the end*
    - Make a map of the challenge
    - Ask the experts
    - Pick a target: an ambitious but manageable piece of the problem that you can solve in five days
  - DAY2: Sketch     
    - *Focus on solutions*
    - A review of existing ideas to remix and improve
    - Sketch
    - Recruiting customers for customer test on the fifth day
  - DAY3: Decide
    - *Critique each solution and decide*
    - Let the stakeholders join
    - Weave the winning sketches into storyboard
      - storyboard: a step-by-step plan for your prototype
  - DAY4: Prototype
    - *Fake it*
  - DAY5: Test
    - Interview 5 customers and learn by watching them react to your prototype

**Takeaway**
- Brainstorm *vs* Design alone together
- Voting for the entire concept or only features
- Crazy eight
- User testing tips:
  - Explain there's no right or wrong
  - Start with warm-up questions
  - Ask the reason of the behavior without judge
  - Don't ask questions that will influence the answer
  - Don't try to sell your product
  - Never ask anyone what do they want
